# TriviaGame

The following project is a simple timed trivia game based around the theme of Star Wars memes. It utilizes Bootstrap and jQuery.

The HTML skeleton of the page is contained in index.html. Questions are created dynamically on index.html based on the logic in *assets/javascript/app.js*. The game's images are stored in *assets/images/*. For style, the game's CSS is found in *assets/css/style.css* and its two external fonts are stored in *assets/fonts/*.
